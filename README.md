# Requirements
 - Python 3
 - 10GB disk storage
 - 2GB free RAM
 - Virtualbox
 - Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com)
 - Internet

# How-to
 - Install Virtualbox and Vagrant
 - Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/fabrizio-granelli/dncs-lab`
 - You should be able to launch the lab from within the cloned repo folder.
```
cd dncs-lab
[~/dncs-lab] vagrant up
```
Once you launch the vagrant script, it may take a while for the entire topology to become available.
 - Verify the status of the 4 VMs
 ```
 [dncs-lab]$ vagrant status                                                                                                                                                                
Current machine states:

router                    running (virtualbox)
switch                    running (virtualbox)
host-a                    running (virtualbox)
host-b                    running (virtualbox)
```
- Once all the VMs are running verify you can log into all of them:
`vagrant ssh router`
`vagrant ssh switch`
`vagrant ssh host-a`
`vagrant ssh host-b`
`vagrant ssh host-c`

# Assignment
This section describes the assignment, its requirements and the tasks the student has to complete.
The assignment consists in a simple piece of design work that students have to carry out to satisfy the requirements described below.
The assignment deliverable consists of a Github repository containing:
- the code necessary for the infrastructure to be replicated and instantiated
- an updated README.md file where design decisions and experimental results are illustrated
- an updated answers.yml file containing the details of your project

## Design Requirements
- Hosts 1-a and 1-b are in two subnets (*Hosts-A* and *Hosts-B*) that must be able to scale up to respectively 47 and 164 usable addresses
- Host 2-c is in a subnet (*Hub*) that needs to accommodate up to 31 usable addresses
- Host 2-c must run a docker image (dustnic82/nginx-test) which implements a web-server that must be reachable from Host-1-a and Host-1-b
- No dynamic routing can be used
- Routes must be as generic as possible
- The lab setup must be portable and executed just by launching the `vagrant up` command

## Tasks
- Fork the Github repository: https://github.com/fabrizio-granelli/dncs-lab
- Clone the repository
- Run the initiator script (dncs-init). The script generates a custom `answers.yml` file and updates the Readme.md file with specific details automatically generated by the script itself.
  This can be done just once in case the work is being carried out by a group of (<=2) engineers, using the name of the 'squad lead'. 
- Implement the design by integrating the necessary commands into the VM startup scripts (create more if necessary)
- Modify the Vagrantfile (if necessary)
- Document the design by expanding this readme file
- Fill the `answers.yml` file where required (make sure that is committed and pushed to your repository)
- Commit the changes and push to your own repository
- Notify the examiner (fabrizio.granelli@unitn.it) that work is complete specifying the Github repository, First Name, Last Name and Matriculation number. This needs to happen at least 7 days prior an exam registration date.

# Design
I started by executing the dcns-init script, which assigned me 3 different values that represent the number of different hosts that my subnets must support. This 3 numbers are:
- 47 for host-a
- 164 for host-b
- 31 for host-c

## Subnets
I created 4 different subnets:
1. The first is between the two routers, *router-1* and *router-2*, for which I've chosen the subnet 10.0.1.0/30 because it covers only the two routers (2<sup>32-30</sup>-2=2).
2. The second is between *host-a* and *router-1*, for this I used the subnet 192.168.0.0/26 because 47 different addresses are needed to be covered (2<sup>32-26</sup>-2>47).
3. The third is between *host-b* and *router-1*, so I used the subnet 192.168.1.0/24 to cover all the 164 addresses (2<sup>32-24</sup>-2>164).
4. The last on is between *host-c* and *router-2*, in this case I've chosen to use the subnet 192.168.2.0/26 to cover the 31 addresses (2<sup>32-26</sup>-2>31).

## IP-Map and VLANs


|  Device  |  Interface |      IP       | Subnet |
| :------: | :--------: | :-----------: | :----: |
| Router-1 |   enp0s9   |   10.0.0.1    |   1    |
| Router-2 |   enp0s9   |   10.0.0.2    |   1    |
| Router-1 |  enp0s8.7  |  192.168.0.1  |   2    |
|  Host-a  |   enp0s8   |  192.168.0.2  |   2    |
| Router-1 |  enp0s8.8  |  192.168.2.1  |   3    |
|  Host-b  |   enp0s8   |  192.168.2.2  |   3    |
| Router-2 |   enp0s8   |  192.168.4.1  |   4    |
|  Host-c  |   enp0s8   |  192.168.4.2  |   4    |

I created two VLANs for subnet 2 and 3 with Tag 7 and 8.

# Vagrant configuration

All the commands I used in order to configure the network are included in the shell scripts. Those scripts will configure the network during the creation of the VMs, after the command `vagrant up` and all of them are included in the 'Vagrantfile'. It was necessary to increase the memory size of Host-c vitual machine to 512 MB in order to run the docker image.

## Commands and Configuration

In order to check the correspondency between the interfaces names and the requirements given, I used the command ```dsmeg | grep -i eth``` to do that; then I started to configure my network. 
All the other commands from now on have to be executed by the superuser, so they must be preceded by the keyword 'sudo'.

Hereafter I present the list of commands that I used:

- ```ip addr add [ip_address] dev [interface]``` to assign an IP address to each interface;
- ```ip link set dev [interface] up``` to activate the interface;
- ```ip route add [addresses_covered] via [address] dev [interface]``` to create a route that takes all the traffic to the addresses included in the network [addresses_covered] and direct it to the [address] passing from the [interface];
- ```ip link add link [original_interface] name [VLAN] type vlan id [tag]``` to create a VLAN named [VLAN] from the interface [original_interface] and that add the tag [tag] to the traffic passing through that VLAN;
- ```sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1``` to enable the IPv4 forwarding in the two routers;

## Switch configuration

I then had to setup the switch, assigning the VLAN tags to the ports.
First of all, I created a bridge named "switch" with the command ```ovs-vsctl add-br switch``` then, I configured the ports with the following commands:
```
 ovs-vsctl add-port switch enp0s8
 ovs-vsctl add-port switch enp0s9 tag="2"
 ovs-vsctl add-port switch enp0s10 tag="3"
 ```

## Host C configuration

Since one design requirement was for the Host C to run a docker image, I started with this configuration:
```
 apt-get update
 apt-get -y install docker.io
 systemctl start doker
 systemctl enable docker
 docker pull dustnic82/nginx-test
 docker run -- name nginx -p 80:80 -d dustnic82/nginx-test
 ```

To check if the image was available from *Host-a* and *Host-b* I executed the command ```curl 192.168.2.2``` from each of the two hosts getting the following output as result.
